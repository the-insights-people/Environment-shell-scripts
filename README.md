# Shell Scripts
Shell scripts for setting up my environment in the morning and exiting in the evening

## Setup
I have the setup.sh script aliased to the word 'setup', and pub.sh script aliased to pub in my .bash_profile, which uses the following code:
```bash
alias setup="bash /c/Users/$(whoami)/Documents/bash_scripts/setup.sh"
alias pub="bash /c/Users/$(whoami)/Documents/bash_scripts/pub.sh"

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

## N.B.
To use this on your machines you will have to swap out relevant filepaths in the setup script so that they point towards where you keep the script, homestead box, and portal code.
